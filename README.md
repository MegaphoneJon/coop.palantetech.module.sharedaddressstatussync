coop.palantetech.module.sharedaddressstatussync
===============================================

A CiviCRM example module to synchronize a custom field across shared addresses.

Shared with the community as per the request of linkx: http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/topic,34367.0.html

I do NOT provide unpaid support for this module - it's a quick and dirty hack!  
If you improve it, I will incorporate your pull requests.  If you want to hire me to make it work for you, let's talk.
